/* 
Agents are a kind of Sim_object, and privately inherit from Moving_object.
Agents can be commanded to move to a destination. Agents have a health, which
is decreased when they take a hit. If the Agent's health > 0, it is alive.
If its heath <= 0, it starts dying, then on subsequent updates, 
it becomes dead, and finally disappearing.
