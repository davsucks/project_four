/* 
A Peasant is an Agent that can move food between Structures. It can be commanded to
start_working, whereupon it moves to the source, picks up food, returns to destination,
deposits the food, returns to source.  If picks up zero food at the source, it waits there
and tries again on the next update. 
If commanded to move_to somewhere, it stops working, and goes there.
